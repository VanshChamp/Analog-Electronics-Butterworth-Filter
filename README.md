# Analog Electronics Project: 1st & 2nd Order Butterworth Filter

# Overview

This repository contains the design, analysis, and implementation of a Butterworth filter, developed for a core course in Analog Electronics (Course: 2EC102). The project showcases a strong understanding of active filter theory and hands-on circuit design, including a term paper that delves into the characteristics and applications of both 1st and 2nd-order filters.

The work was completed as a two-part academic exercise:

Practical Implementation: Design and physical construction of a 1st-order Butterworth bandpass filter on a breadboard.

Theoretical Analysis: A comprehensive term paper detailing the design principles of both 1st and 2nd-order Butterworth filters and their comparison to other filter types.

Project for: Nirma University, Institute of Technology, B. Tech. Semester IV
Team: Budania Niti Mahavir (23BEC026) & Vansh Champaneri (23BEC027)

# Key Project Deliverables
1. 1st-Order Bandpass Filter Implementation
This circuit was designed to create a bandpass filter with a low cutoff frequency (f 
L
​
 ) of approximately 1.5 kHz and a high cutoff frequency (f 
H
​
 ) of approximately 53 kHz. The design utilizes passive RC components and an LM741 operational amplifier for buffering and impedance matching to achieve a maximally flat response in the passband. The filter was built and tested to verify its performance.

Key Components Used:

Operational Amplifier: LM741

Resistors: 100 kΩ, 10 kΩ, 3 kΩ

Capacitors: 0.001 µF

Included Files:

AE_Report_23BEC026_23BEC027.docx: The project report detailing the design, construction, peripheral used, and working principle of the 1st-order filter.

Circuit diagrams and simulation results are available within the report.

2. Term Paper on Butterworth Filters
The term paper provides a detailed theoretical background on Butterworth filters and other filter types, highlighting their unique characteristics and applications. It covers the mathematical derivations and includes a comparative analysis of different filters.

# Key Topics Covered:

Filter Types: A summary of Butterworth, Chebyshev, Bessel, and Elliptical filters.

Theoretical Design: Mathematical derivation and frequency response characteristics for 1st and 2nd-order Butterworth filters.

Circuit Analysis: Zero-pole analysis of 2nd-order filters.

Applications: A discussion of real-world applications in audio signal processing, biomedical instrumentation, and communication systems.
